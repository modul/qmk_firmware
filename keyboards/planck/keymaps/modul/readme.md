# The modul Planck Layout

My own take on a Planck layout. It has some nice navigation features
and is optimized for use with a Neo2 software layout. 

At some point it should also support a simplified native Neo2 layout
for use with german software layouts so I can plug in anywhere
and still use most Neo2 features I'm used to.

## Layers
I should insert the layouts of all layers here â€¦
